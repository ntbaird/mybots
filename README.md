# OCTOPOD Project!
Assignment 5 for CS 396 - Artificial Life

TO RUN THE SIMULATION:

In your Python terminal of choice, run search.py
This may look like the following:

python search.py
python3 search.py

If any problems arise with inaccessible fitness files or locked body.urdf, please try running the command again.

That's it! If you would like to see some of the initial random bots, change the number of generations and population size in constants.py to both be 1.
