# Finalized Evolution of Arm-Bots
Final Project for CS 396 - Artificial Life

![](https://github.com/ntbaird/mybots/blob/Final/data/7egcng.gif)

TO RUN THE SIMULATION:

First: Check out constants.py to make sure you are satisfied with the population size and number of generations!
Now you have two options, running the evolution from the beginning, or viewing the final robots.

</br>
TO VIEW THE FINAL ROBOTS:

In your Python terminal of choice, run simulate.py with the following arguments:

python simulate.py GUI (generation number) (seed number)

You can find these values inside the "brains" or "bodies" folder (#seedbody#)

</br>
ALTERNATIVELY, you may run the evolution from the beginning

This may look like the following:

python search.py
or python3 search.py

</br>
If any problems arise with inaccessible fitness files or locked body.urdf, please try running the command again.

The code took roughly 3 hours on my machine for 50k simulations, so please plan accordingly or re-pull the brains & bodies for the final creatures of my latest run.

# Method
These bots are generated by first starting with a head and torso, then randomly extending the arms out on either side of the torso in the X, Y, and Z directions (up to a "Maximum Segment" length specified in the constants file). These segments are sized randomly, but symmetrically across the body of the creature. This can also be mirrored to produce a true quadruped (that would most likely not fall over!). Occasionally the robots will evolve to put their arms below the ground, which causes physics issues. This is because a default height of 5 is set, which can be too low for robots that generate purely in the Z-direction. Additionally, there is a bug in the generation of the first arm on the torso that can cause the arms to be visibly detached from the torso.

After creation, these robots are then evolved to travel as far as possible in the positive X and Y directions. A parallel hill climber algorithm allows for a population of 10 of these robots to travel at the same time. Please see the following section for a more in-depth explanation of how the hill climber works.

At the end of every generation, the best fitness of the population is recorded for the purposes of the fitness progression, shown in the "Fitness Curves" section.

# How it REALLY Works

We start in search.py, which combs through each of the 10 seeds for evolution and the best robot from that evolution. The parallel hill climber begins creating the bodies for the population size, and runs the simulation of each robot in the population. Then, the hill climber spawns a child, mutates it, and simulates it to compare its fitness against the parent. This is where selection occurs. If the child is deemed more fit than the parent for the task at hand, we proceed with the child as our new parent to mutate from. The process of spawning, mutating, simulating, and selecting repeats over 500 generations for each robot in the population.

Unfortunately, the most recent run (with files included) shows subpar robots that resulted from evolution. The code was run three times (> 9 hours of simulations!); robots from these other runs are included in the video attached at the top.

The above graph shows the TEN seeded versions of these robots over 500 generations with a population size of 10 per generation. (That's 50k simulations!!)
