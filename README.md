# Finalized Evolution of Arm-Bots
Final Project for CS 396 - Artificial Life

![](https://github.com/ntbaird/mybots/blob/Final/data/7egcng.gif)

TO RUN THE SIMULATION:

First: Check out constants.py to make sure you are satisfied with the population size and number of generations!
Now you have two options, running the evolution from the beginning, or viewing the final robots.

</br>
TO VIEW THE FINAL ROBOTS:

In your Python terminal of choice, run simulate.py with the following arguments:

python simulate.py GUI (generation number) (seed number)

You can find these values inside the "brains" or "bodies" folder (#seedbody#)

</br>
ALTERNATIVELY, you may run the evolution from the beginning

This may look like the following:

python search.py
or python3 search.py

</br>
If any problems arise with inaccessible fitness files or locked body.urdf, please try running the command again.

The code took roughly 3 hours on my machine for 50k simulations, so please plan accordingly or re-pull the brains & bodies.

# Inspiration/Goal
Karl Sims' Evolved Creatures in competition:

The first bot needed to evolve for turning and moving in the +XY direction, while the second found more success with a larger structure.

# Method
These bots are generated by first starting with a head and torso, then randomly extending the arms out on either side of the torso in the X, Y, and Z directions. These segments are sized randomly, but symmetrically across the body of the creature. This can also be mirrored to produce a true quadruped (that would most likely not fall over!)

After creation, these robots are then evolved to travel as far as possible in the positive X and Y directions. Each generation introduces a new randomly generated synaptic weight as well as a slight modification to a length, width, or height of a segment of the robot (up to +- .5 per generation).

The above graph shows the TEN seeded versions of these robots over 500 generations with a population size of 10 per generation. (That's 50k simulations!!)

# Rubric Items left to do
1pt physics - there's a bug that creates malformed creatures & sometimes they learn to exploit physics by evolving downward since I do not account for their initial height when placing them.

5pts - summary video link somewhere

2pts - Methods

4pts - Results
