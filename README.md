# Random Snakes
Assignment 6 for CS 396 - Artificial Life

TO RUN THE SIMULATION:

In your Python terminal of choice, run search.py
This may look like the following:

python search.py
or python3 search.py

If any problems arise with inaccessible fitness files or locked body.urdf, please try running the command again.

That's it!

# Snapshots of the Snakes
These "snakes" have been randomly generated with different segment counts and sizes. Green segments include sensors while the blue segments do not.
